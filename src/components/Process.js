                    At first contact, we will discuss your background and interests, and then the opportunities and benefits that would be available to you. Following this appointment we will schedule you for a practice ASVAB. The next step would be to gather medical and personal data and schedule you for the ASVAB and medical at MEPS (Military Entrance Processing).

                    Depending on your location and transportation, we will place you in a hotel so you can arrive at MEPS at 6am. You will first take the ASVAB, which can take anywhere from 2-6 hours. If you receive a score higher than 10, you will proceed with Medical. AND I DONT KNOW HOW THE ENTIRETY OF THIS PROCESS GOES.
